This directory contains some example AngCor inputs or input-generation codes. These exist for testing purposes - you can try running them on your machine to check that you get consistent results.

The output files of the tests are also saved in this directory - try to avoid overwriting them!

run ../angor < input > output
diff -y test_output output

This will first run the AngCor output file and then will print out the two AngCor output files next to each other so you can check for consistency.
